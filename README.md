  "When Gon and Killua decided to develop<br>
  the program 'ta tta ttaa'<br>
  to hack the defense system of the Camera Ants,<br>
  they faced the challenge of communicating with each other<br>
  to contribute to the program, especially since they were working<br>
  in secret and might end up working alone.<br>
  Consequently, they decided to use Git and GitHub<br>
  to maintain all versions of their program and contribute smoothly."<br>
